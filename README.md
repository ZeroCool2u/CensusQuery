# CensusQuery
My first project capable of handling and working with large data sets. Specifically the entirety of US Census data.
This project has largely been unmodified since my freshman year of college. 

CensusQuery was developed using the fantastic miniconda environment. 

Prerequsites & Dependencies: 

Though this is included in the source code, it is important to note that both csv and matplotlib are mandatory dependencies and
and their installion are prerequesite to running CensusQuery. I suggest using pip if you prefer manual dependency resolution. 

Shoutout to Professor Segre at the UIowa CS department and Tim McRoy for their supremely helpful guidance and unyielding patience.
